# IAAF-TOP-SCORING-ATHLETE-DATA-DASHBOARD
Uses collected data from official page of International Association of Athletics Federation to showcase performance of countries in relation to other varibales such as number of athletes or number of event in a dashboard created in powerBI.


## Inspiration 

I wanted to see how different countries produced top scoring athletes from the 2021/2022 athletics season. I took the top 1000 scoring male athletes and top 1000 scoring female athletes from IAAF ranking page ( female : https://worldathletics.org/world-rankings/overall-ranking/women?regionType=world&page=1&rankDate=2023-01-17&limitByCountry=0 , male: https://worldathletics.org/world-rankings/overall-ranking/men?regionType=world&page=1&rankDate=2023-01-17&limitByCountry=0).
